This program will perform the following tasks:
   1) It will ask user for three test score
   2) It will calculate the mean of the three test scores
   3) It will convert the mean into a letter grade (See
      find_letter_grade function for the mapping)
   4) It will display the mean score and letter grade
It will display an error message if the entered score is non-numerical
