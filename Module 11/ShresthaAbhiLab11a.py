This program will perform the following tasks:
   1) It will ask user for a number - number must be greater than or equal
      to 2. If the user enters a number less than 2 (1, 0, or any
      negative number then it will display an error message. In the same
      it will display an error message if the user enters a non-numerical
      or a floating point number
   2) It will calculate and display all prime numbers between 2
      and the user entered number.
